# An Introduction to S.O.L.I.D.

## Firstly, what is S.O.L.I.D.?

SOLID is an acronym for the 5 principles of Object Orientated Design, created by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob). It stands for:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open-Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependancy Inversion Principle

## Why Follow These Principles?

As a software developer, your goal should be to create code that loosley coupled, highly cohesive, reusable and easy to maintain. Following the SOLID principles helps you reach these goals.

"In essence, high cohesion means keeping parts of a code base that are related to each other in a single place. Low coupling, at the same time, is about separating unrelated parts of the code base as much as possible." - [Vladimir Khorikov](http://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2015/09/02/cohesion-coupling-difference/)
